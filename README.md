## üöÄ Project Overview
SteamNoodles is a modern restaurant chain that gathers customer feedback about food, service, and ambiance. This project implements an **AI-powered multi-agent system** to automate feedback processing and sentiment analysis.  

**Agents included:**

- **Feedback Response Agent:**  
  Detects the sentiment of customer reviews (Positive, Negative, Neutral) using an LLM and generates short, polite, professional replies automatically.  

- **Sentiment Visualization Agent:**  
  Creates plots showing sentiment trends over any specified date range, supporting inputs like `"today"`, `"yesterday"`, `"last 7 days"`, or `"YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD"`.  

The system leverages **LangChain + ChatGroq (Llama3-70B)** with Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `dateparser`.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **AI-powered sentiment detection** for customer reviews.  
- **Automated, context-aware replies** to feedback.  
- **Flexible date-based filtering** with natural language inputs.  
- **Interactive and exportable plots** via matplotlib and seaborn.  
- **CSV-based data source** for easy integration and updates.
